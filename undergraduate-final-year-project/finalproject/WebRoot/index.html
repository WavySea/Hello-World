							Students can do tests on this system and find out the help with their wrong items.</span> Students also have chances to discuss together 
							about a certain question and get help from teachers. Students can record and review their wrong questions and do similar questions in order
							to consolidate the knowledge.</p>
							
							<p>It is also a good website for teachers to know more about students. They can know how students active in the learning website and what is
							the most difficult point for students to revise their course. However, teachers are also given a platform to communicate more with students

								<p> CSCL is a pedagogical approach wherein learning takes place via social interaction using a computer or through the Internet. This kind 
								of learning is characterized by the sharing and construction of knowledge among participants using technology as their primary means of 
								communication or as a common resource. CSCL can be implemented in online and classroom learning environments and can take place synchronously
								 or asynchronously.</p>

								<p>Tutor plays an important role in the collaborative learning. Though students learned knowledge motivating by themselves, tutor is the one to 
								control the whole process of collaborative learning. Tutor would provide proper solutions to studentsâ€™ questions and instruct students to deal 
								with their debates and set up a proper learning goal. </p>
